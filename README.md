# Navbar

## Description

In this project a navigation menu, which becomes a sandwich menu on devices with small screens, was created. Then, JS was used to control the menu display.

## Takeaway

Altough we can use classList.contains() in combination with classList.add()/classList.remove() to control the display of a Node, there's the classList.toggle() function which can be used to provide the same result.
